## Next tasks

- Implement file metadata extraction that works on a rasp-pi
- Design upload UX/UI dialogue with both a simple upload page by default, and a more advanced one for adding individual
  details to images
- Look into how IAS3 handles file metadata, and whether this app should manually create _meta.txt files with both
  automatic and manually input metadata

## Stuff to do / check out later on

* Automatic parity upload to ImageSnippets
* Allowing users to input their IA username and making them the owner of the upload
* Filtering out images with people wearing "don't photograph" lanyards
* Automatic image content recognition/tagging?
